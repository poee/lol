Our beliefs are founded primarily on [Platonism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism). We affirm the existence of abstract objects, and that the highest form of reality lies in the realm of Ideas and information.

We recognize that we are blessed with the gift of reason, allowing us to form Ideas about the perceptions of our senses, and further to form knowledge about all that which is intelligible.

We recognize that no other intelligence is yet apparent in the universe. We believe that this evident isolation and uniqueness instills in each of us the sacred obligation to thoughtfully engage with other intelligences, and to make an earnest effort to advance ourselves both as individuals and as a group through the human enterprises of science, discovery, art and discourse.

We recognize that all physical reality is ultimately changeable and chaotic, ineffable except through the use of shared Ideas about nature. We consequently view the pursuit of mundane achievements as, not inherently bad, but fundamentally empty, transient and therefore misguided. Lasting joy can be found in the realm of Ideas: by gaining understanding, expressing oneself through creativity, sharing knowledge with others, and experiencing personal growth.

We recognize the power of symbolism and personification in spiritual discourse. We accept the usefulness of divine characters and supernatural beings as tools for communicating and understanding Ideas. However, we plainly reject the notion of any paranormal intervention by these beings, and emphasize that all empirical observation indicates the physical universe operates autonomously, with no indication of a supernatural intelligence.
