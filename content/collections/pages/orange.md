### Can god make up a joke she doesn't understand?

Some tedious fools are still asking if god can lift infinitely heavy rocks, but Erisians know the answer is "yes, after a nap", and choose to probe the deeper questions.

What does it take to think up a joke? Is it the free-association of different words, arriving at a novel sentence?

For example, "I'll have the eggs benedict." or "The unusual cabinet gestures into the spicy slingshot."

No, it's not just any old words slapped together in a new way.

A joke needs a context, it needs to connect _ideas_ in a surprising way. Yet those ideas must be shared between the teller and the listener for there to be anything to laugh about. Take for example a simple joke that most young children learn: the one with the punchline "Orange you glad I didn't say banana?"

Whoever thought up that joke, they needed to be in a world that already had knock-knock jokes, because it's a play on the formula. Which means they needed a world with doors, and houses. Their world also needed those two fruits on it, which means it had to have evolved flowers, and scientists who were interested in cross-breeding plants. That joke was made up in the linguistic context of English, because "orange" sounds like "aren't", something that's highly unlikely to be true in a language that evolved on an alien planet, and is probably only rarely true for other languages on Earth.

There is no way to jump to this punchline and skip all the intervening context which made it possible. You cannot, so to speak, make up this joke "from scratch". Now you might say, what if I just took an infinite number of typewriting monkeys, surely they would arrive at this punchline much more quickly than the complete works of Shakespeare. And that's fair - if they only were typing ASCII characters they would have a 1 in 7.2Ã—10<sup>75</sup> chance of producing that sentence at random, the same chance as any other 36-character long string. If there were one trillion monkeys each typing out one sentence every millisecond, it would only take about 1.66Ã—10<sup>43</sup> ages of the universe. _So you're telling me there's a chance._

But would they understand it? Could it be a _joke_ if it had no known referent and was simply produced randomly? Would Eris find it delightful when she told it? Or would she not _get it_?

That is to say, even if you are an all-powerful being, you cannot reach into the infinity of information and imagination to simply pluck a joke like an apple. You must walk into that infinity. You must proceed through the entire history of evolutionary and linguistic life on Earth, to find yourself in a moment where making up this joke is possible. As a listener, you must have walked that same path, be a product of that same history, to appreciate the joke when you hear it. Oh what a rare and precious thing to hear a Dad joke.

### Why is there something, rather than nothing?

Let's go back, way back - 5 billion years ago. The material that will eventually make up Earth hasn't even gathered yet, it's just gas and floating dust.

It's not particularly funny. In fact it's quite boring.

> For Eris so loved the joke, that she gave her radiant Sun, that whoever evolveth around it should not be bored but have eternal laugh.
