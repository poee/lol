By developing language, we opened ourselves up to **information**, and began to use it as a resource.

Information has always been a fundamental part of all life. DNA stores the information necessary to produce a living thing. An organism's senses provide it with information about the outside world, allowing it to react appropriately. Both of these mechanisms are important, but they are slow and limited compared to the ways intelligence and language interact with information. DNA changes randomly, depending on evolutionary forces to select successful genes after the fact rather than actively predicting which genes would be beneficial. Human language allows us to store information as a group, which minimizes the amount of information needed to communicate.

For example, if a lookout wanted to communicate to his tribe that a pride of eight lions was nearby, he would have to first describe the physical features of the lions, in effect duplicating the sensory signal that he himself received. He might draw a picture, or gesture the shape of a lion's mane. He would then have to indicate distance somehow, and quantity, perhaps by drawing pictures of landmarks and striking |||||||| on a stone or holding up fingers. Without any *shared information*, the complexity of his message is very high, and the communication is inefficient.

By using language, however, he can rely on a great deal of the information which is already present within his listeners, who are familiar with the ideas of lions, miles, and numbers and their corresponding words. The lookout can in effect compress his message by using these shared ideas and simply communicating "eight lions are a mile away." If he were in a rush, he might even be able to get away with "eight lions, one mile" and still be reasonably clear.

### Intelligence
The mind does not stop there. Having fully established these ideas, we will create new information, like the average size of a lion pride, the typical areas where they hunt or sleep, the patterns of their behavior which indicate weaknesses to exploit. With complex enough language, all of these ideas can be communicated to the group, and everyone can pool their intelligence to create increasingly complex information about the situation. This may seem obvious, but it is our species' unique tactic for survival, and it has been incredibly successful.

It seems that information is itself a resource, like food or stone. But unlike those resources it is not finite. We can apply a process, which is called *intelligence*,  to available information, increasing its complexity and value. Unlike food, however, our hunger for information is never satisfied. Today, our pursuit of knowledge has shown us that the world of information is far more complicated than just things we can see and touch, and has applications far beyond avoiding a pride of lions. Fiction, music, and most of all mathematics and computer science can operate on information alone, completely divorced from the physical world. This quality leads us to see information as something extraordinary, something that we are *discovering* more than *inventing*.

We propose that information is real, and that humanity's endeavor for knowledge is the clear indication of our purpose. For information does not gain complexity on its own, it requires the dedicated effort of intelligent beings and their machines. So far, all evidence disappointingly indicates that we are the *only intelligence existing in the universe*. It is, then, not only our privilege but our responsibility to increase the amount of information that is available for intelligent processing.

Our existence may likely be an unplanned accident of evolution. Nevertheless it represents a sacred opportunity to do something nothing else can, to use our unique ability to more fully explore the world of information.
