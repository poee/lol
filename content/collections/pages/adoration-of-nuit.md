<blockquote>
<p>I adore Thee, Nuit, adore the agonies and trials
<br>I adore the deadly deep desperation,
<br>The uneven sleepless nights, vials
<br>Of Thy eternal loneliness in manifestation.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>I adore Thee, Nuit, Thou glorious One unfulfilled
<br>Through every interstice of space.
<br>Today and always this life is spilled
<br>In ecstasy of Thine unwearying embrace.
</p>
