Did you know that you have a lopsided pineal gland?
<br><br>Well, probably you do have one, and it’s unfortunate because lopsided Pineal Glands have perverted the Free Spirit of Humanity, and subverted Life into a frustrating, unhappy and hopeless mess.
<br><br>Fortunately, you have before you a guide that will show you how to discover your salvation fnord through *Eris, the Goddess of Confusion*. It will advise you how to balance your Pineal Gland and reach spiritual Illumination. And it will teach you how to turn your miserable mess into a beautiful, joyful, and splendid one. Can you believe that?
