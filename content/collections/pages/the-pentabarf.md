The PENTABARF was discovered by the hermit <a href="/nom/beati#zarathud">Apostle Zarathud</a> in the Fifth Year of The Caterpillar. He found them carved in gilded stone, while building a sun deck for his cave, but their import was lost for they were written in a mysterious cypher. However, after 10 weeks & 11 hours of intensive scrutiny he discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head and viewing it upside down.

The original tablets are since lost to the ages but Zarathud's followers preserved their holesome content down to this very day.
