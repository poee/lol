The PENTABARF was discovered by the hermit <a href="/nom/beati#zarathud">Apostle Zarathud</a> in the Fifth Year of The Caterpillar. He found them carved in gilded stone, while building a sun deck for his cave, but their import was lost for they were written in a mysterious cypher. However, after 10 weeks & 11 hours of intensive scrutiny he discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head and viewing it upside down.

The original tablets are since lost to the ages but Zarathud's followers preserved their holesome content down to this very day.

### KNOW YE THIS O PEEPS OF FAITH!

I - There is no god but ERIS and SOPHIA and HADIT and GAEA and HYDRARGYROS and They are Certainly Your God(dess)(e)(s). There is no Erisian Movement but The Erisian Movement and it is The Erisian Movement. And every Golden Apple Corps is the beloved home of a Golden Worm.

III - A Discordian is Required during their early Illumination to Go Off Alone & Partake Joyously of a ~~Vegan Hot Dog with Cheese on a Friday~~; this Devotive Ceremony to Remonstrate against the popular Paganisms of the Day: of Catholic Christendom (no meat on Friday), of Judaism (no meat of Pork), of Hindic Peoples (no meat of Beef), of Buddhists (no meat of animal), of Discordians (no Hot Dog Buns), of Literalists (no non-Meat), and of Dogmatists (no Cheese).

IV - A Discordian shall Partake of No Hot Dog Buns, for Such was the Solace of Our Goddess when She was Confronted with The Original Snub.
