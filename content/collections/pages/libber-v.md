Libber V is divided into four wards and two phases.

The first ward is **Eastward**. The second is **Sunward**: the direction of the noonday sun. The third is **Westward**. The last is **Poleward**: the direction of the nearest of Earth's poles. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, Poleward is North.

Begin by orientating yourself. Modern phones typically include a compass if you aren't sure which direction is East. If performing Libber V indoors, choosing the nearest wall to each of the cardinal directions is fine - no need to worry about facing precisely East.

Face **Eastward**.

This is the direction of emerging. Give the sign of LOGOS.

*Inscribe the pentagram before you; then give the sign of Silence.*

Turn deasil, **Sunward**.

This is the direction of midday. Exalt our Lady of Gold and give the sign of RAY'S.

*Inscribe the pentagram before you; then give the sign of Silence.*

Continue turning, face **Westward**.
