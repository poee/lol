Approximately 2.6 million years ago, humans began using the first stone tools, created by breaking sharp pieces off of larger rocks.

For *one million years*, these broken river rocks represented the height of human technology. Eventually, the early humans developed finer control over how the stones broke, and were able to shape symmetrical pointed handaxes.

From there, it took more than a million years for humans to begin controlling fire, and 300,000 more years before the control of fire was widespread. Around the same time, we started creating jewelery, trading, and creating more complex tools by attaching stone to wood.

More than 50,000 years later we developed natural language, beginning our accelerating ascent, through oven-fired clay, the invention of the bow and arrow, polished stone, agriculture, the wheel, bronze smelting, writing and law, iron, democracy, paper, money, the printing press, vaccination, and the steam engine.

Within the last mere *two hundred years*, we have seen an explosion of technology: refrigeration, the telegraph, oil drilling and refinery, sanitation, and all the fruits of the industrial revolution which are so familiar as to not require listing.

### Scope
We may be vaguely aware of our technological history, but it's rare that we consciously consider the astounding scale of the human enterprise, and the incredible acceleration we are experiencing as a species. It took one million years to create symmetrical stone tools; we went from the [Ericsson R380](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson_R380) to the [Nexus 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_5) in 13 years, <sup>1</sup>â„<sub>75,000</sub> the time.

For the vast majority of human existence, absolutely nothing changed technologically during a single person's life. Today, new advancements are announced weekly.

With these industrial and digital advances, our lives are no longer dominated by the frantic search for food and shelter, but by a frantic search for information and networking. Similarly, the invisible gods of the past who promised health and wisdom pale in comparison to the products of our own visible intellect, which can train our body to recognize disease even before we encounter it, and can analyze digitized knowledge to answer almost any question within minutes, if not milliseconds.

This transition, from preoccupation with the physical to concentration on the mental/digital, represents a fundamental shift in our existence - a milestone that, having been reached, requires a reanalysis of our purpose and future.
