Did you know that you have a lopsided pineal gland?
<br><br>Well, probably you do have one, and itâ€™s unfortunate because lopsided Pineal Glands have perverted the Free Spirit of Humanity, and subverted Life into a frustrating, unhappy and hopeless mess.
<br><br>Fortunately, you have before you a guide that will show you how to discover your salvation fnord through
~~Eris, the Goddess of Confusion~~. It will advise you how to balance your Pineal Gland and reach spiritual Illumination. And it will teach you how to turn your miserable mess into a beautiful, joyful, and splendid one. Do you believe that?

POEE is one manifestation of
<br>THE DISCORDIAN SOCIETY
<br>about which you will learn more
<br>and understand
<br>less

<br><br>We are a tribe of philosophers, theologians,
<br>magicians, scientists, artists, clowns,
<br>and similar maniacs
<br>who are intrigued with
<br>ERIS GODDESS OF CONFUSION
<br>and with Her
<br>Doings

Now with half of the answers, and five times the questions on which your very Liff depends.

<br>We have made it through the beginnings of the information revolution with blinding speed, and are left stunned as we try to face energy demands, social restructuring, rise of fuschism, and looming destruction.

Disorder is growing in a most visible sense.
<br>Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!
