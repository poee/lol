### 1. Loneliness

The first Disappointment is a simple observable fact, one both cosmic and personal. We are alone. Despite all of our best efforts, we have yet to find evidence of any other intelligent beings except for the limited animal intelligences we see around us on Earth. Despite all of our hoping and fantasizing, there seems to be no God to respond to our prayers (the lack of miracles we might understand, even forgive - but not even offering advice just seems cruel). Humanity has no sounding board, no oracle or older brother to turn to. We are on our own out here.

Our personal loneliness seems dull and petty in comparison, but it's no less disheartening. No other person can ever truly understand us, to see the world the way we see it. We can never truly communicate the content of our minds. Although we may make friends, gain reputation, or fall in love, every living thing still dies alone.

### 2. [_c_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light)

If we did, optimistically, discover other regions of interesting space, it would take a _very_ long time to visit, or even to communicate with any intelligences there. As far as we can tell, the Universe stubbornly refuses to allow anything, not even information, to move any faster than the universal transmission speed limit of around 300,000,000 meters per second, _c_.

We don't yet know how common intelligence is in the Universe, nor do we know how far humanity will spread among the stars. We can allow ourselves to think positively, and imagine a future "Galactic Federation" of enlightened worlds. But... if we can't break _c_, it seems that all Life will be forever fragmented, dealing with delays and nearly insurmountable information horizons which isolate and compartmentalize any knowledge growth within the network.

### 3. [The Inverse-square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law)

The inverse-square law for light intensity describes the fact that radiation loses intensity at a rate proportional to the square of the distance from the source. This means that, not only do we have to deal with incredible and awe-inspiring cosmic distances, but any signals broadcast by intelligences or by ourselves will fade readily and become much harder to detect.

For comparison, although the Earth is only 2.6 times further away from the Sun than Mercury, the Sun's intensity is felt nearly seven times weaker (thankfully!) here than it is at Mercury. At a larger scale, Eris is nearly 70 times further away from the Sun than Earth, but the Sun's intensity is nearly 4,500 times weaker there than here.

A 1kW signal from a transmitter on Earth has an intensity of 80 W/m<sup>2</sup>, one meter from the source. Let's be optimistic and assume that life evolves on the nearest known mesoplanet [Tae Ceti e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_Ceti_e). That same signal will be diminished to 6.28x10<sup>-23</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> by the time it reaches Tau Ceti e. By the time it reaches the next closest known mesoplanet, [Gliese 667 Cc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_667_Cc) we're down to 1.6x10<sup>-33</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>. You can see where we're going here.

### 4. [Dark Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy)

It's not enough that the nearest habitable planets are still pretty far away (not to mention silent), that there's a universal speed limit that prevents us from reaching them quickly, and that any signals sent will lose strength readily.

No, the Universe has a few more Disappointments up its sleeve. It turns out that the distances between galaxies are always increasing. Dark Energy isn't well-understood yet, but observations indicate that the universe is expanding, and that the rate of the expansion is increasing. Everything is getting further away. We can expect distant galaxies to continue to redshift until they are practically invisible. Any signals we send in their direction (or vice-versa) will never reach their destination, because the distance is growing faster than the light can traverse it. It seems that the expansion of the universe only rubs salt in the wounds of the first three Disappointments. Not only are we isolated, but our isolation is only expected to worsen as the Universe progresses. See [Regions of Empty Space](/read/regions-of-empty-space) for more about expansion.

(Thankfully, gravity is strong enough to counteract this expansive force locally, but it will still severely limit the region with which any intelligence is able to interact.)

### 5 [Second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics)

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed system increases as the system progresses. Whenever energy in a system is used to do some work, there's less useful energy left in the system. Everything progresses towards uniformity and decay. When you burn gasoline to power your car, you can't collect the exhaust to power the car again. When you melt some ice in your drink to cool it down, you can't wave a wand to make the ice's water molecules reassemble so you can use the ice to cool down a second drink too.

As the Sun pumps energy into Earth's system, we experience a temporary decrease in entropy that has allowed great complexity to arise here. But the Sun will cool down and die eventually, as will the Earth. All complex systems will inexorably tend towards uniformity and uselessness. By applying our intelligence, we can skillfully collect energy and use it to do work, but at the universal scale, there's no escaping the entropic end that the second law demands.

### +1 (Death)

This Disappointment is a +1 for a few reasons. Firstly, it's not necessarily universal like the others. We don't know how Life evolved elsewhere in the Universe. It seems likely that it too would die, but who knows - there are lifeforms on Earth that don't die without the presence of disease or trauma. Second, it's the easiest to overcome, if we choose to. Death isn't a fact of physical reality so much as it is a fact of our particular configuration. With cybernetics, improved medicine, or virtualization of the mind, death may become irrelevant in due time.

In the meantime though, it really does suck. No matter how much you learn, how much you are beloved, how much money you make, or how deeply you enjoy your life, it will come to an end. You won't get to see how the human race grows after you die. There will be a sweet new computer interface that comes out in the year 2209 and you won't get to try it. Your grandchildren will have grandchildren, hopefully, but they'll never be able to meet you.

There's a third reason death is a +1, though: it's not all bad. Death is a motivator. Death is something that puts our lives in perspective, something that's always with us and which has defined our species' ascent. It provides a driving force of urgency behind our actions, it forces us to take risks and act boldly rather than wait for the perfect moment. Death cleans house, too. Our brains tend to lose their sponginess as we get older - it becomes harder to grasp new ideas or to change our minds. Death helps the human race grow and change. We're all just nodes in a network, and sometimes you just have to take a node offline so a fresh one can take its place.
