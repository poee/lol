_Sensing the imperative to forge a strong connection between numeric and verbal expressions, the ancient Illuminati devised an adept system and wove it into the languages of the world._

_Embedded in our modern-day linguistic roots and compounds lies their heretofore hidden principle — an understanding of which shall allow any magus to quickly ascertain the secret relation._

The Kibbaler does not require mastery of esoteric knowledge, Hebrew correspondences or even arithmetic. It is simple, accessible, and 105% reliable, utilizing an easy to memorize formula:

<h3>
  ¡Beware of <span style={{ color: "red" }}>RED HERRINGS</span>!
</h3>

Although the ~~Illuminated Seers~~ sought to craft languages with perfect Kibbalistic attributions, their aspiration was not without opposition.

~~The Powers That Be~~, seeking to obfuscate the Kibbaler and deny the masses its wisdom, introduced countless additional words (many of them fnords and plurals) to the lingua franca.

As you come to greater understanding of the mystereeous system here revealed, beware their peppered red herrings, which lurk in lexeme galore.
