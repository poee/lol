## A revolutionary calendar

This calendar aims to radically rethink our relationship to work, and to acknowledge the Earth's natural cycles.

- **Anchored to the seasons** - The year is divided into four sections, each marked with a Season Day. These correspond to the equinoxes and solstices of the tropical year.
- **Friday comes a day early** - By shortening the work week to 6 days, Friday now always comes a day early. The useless day of Thursday has been removed, resulting in a 4:2 cycle of work:rest. This increases the number of days off to 125 per year (compared to 104 days for a worker who's currently working 5 days out of 7, in the Gregorian calendar).
  - There are 5 holidays of rest built into the calendar in addition to the reduced work week (6 on leap years).
  - Never again will you have to write "T" and "Th" on your planner, there's just one day that starts with T now. You're welcome.
- **Consistency** - Have you ever asked yourself, "What day of the week is October 10th?" For that pesky Gregorian calendar, the 10th is on a different day of the week every month, which also changes each year! In the improved calendar, months always start on a Monday and end on a Sunday. So you'll be able to memorize, for example, that the 10th always falls on a Friday.
  - Each month has exactly five weeks, so you never have to remember whether a month has 30 or 31 (or 28!) days -- they all have 30.
- **Less writing** - Aren't you sick of carrying around that cumbersome "20" when writing the year? This calendar resets year zero to occur in 2000, so that we can focus on the current millenium.
