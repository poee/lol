### A revolutionary calendar

This calendar aims to radically rethink our relationship to work, and to acknowledge the Earth's natural cycles.

- **Anchored to the seasons** - The year is divided into four sections, each marked with a Season Day. These correspond to the equinoxes and solstices of the tropical year.
- **Friday comes a day early** - By shortening the work week to 6 days, Friday now always comes a day early. The unsavory day of Thursday has been removed, resulting in a 4 : 2 cycle of work : rest.

  This alone increases the number of days off to 120 per year (from 104 days for a worker who's today working 5 days out of 7, in the Gregorian calendar). There is a sometimes a seventh day of the week for Holidays. It comes after Sunday and before Monday, acting as an extended weekend:
  - On each of the four *Season Days*, on 0/1, 0/4, 0/7, and 0/10.
  - *Intermission* at the end of summer (winter in the Southern Hemisphere), the day after 30/6 and before 0/7. A time of rest and pause.
  - On leap years, the extra day will be *Calendar Day*, a day to celebrate and appreciate this improved calendar and its designers. Occurs before the southward equinox season day, as an extended Intermission.
- **Consistency** - Have you ever asked yourself, "What day of the week is October 10th?" For that pesky Gregorian calendar, the 10th is on a different day of the week every month, which also changes each year! In the improved calendar, months always start on a Monday and end on a Sunday. So you'll be able to memorize, for example, that the 10th always falls on a Friday.
  - Each month has exactly five weeks, so you never have to remember whether a month has 30 or 31 or 28 days -- they all have 30.
  - Forget the "Th" from your planner, there's just one day that starts with T now.
- **y2k is over** - We're done carrying around a meaningless "20" at the beginning the year. Let's resets year zero to occur in 2000, so that we can focus on the current millenium. Helpfully, 2000 was a once-in-400-years skipped leap year, so it doesn't shift the cycle.
